                <h1>Suzanne Collions</h1>
                <p>The Hunger Games was written by the American author and televised writer, Suzanne Collins. Born on August 10th 1962, Collins started her career as a writer for children’s television shows in 1991. In September 2008, scholastic press,a american multinational publishing company released the Hunger games, the first book of a series by Collins. It was partly inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. She was also inspired by her father’s career in the air force which gave her an understanding about poverty, starvation and the effects of war.
                <br><br>
                Suzanne Collins made her book about a dystopian world because she was inspired by the contrast of reality tv and war coverage on the news which made her imagine where violence is used as entertainment and control. This idea became the world of Panem, controlled by fear and the Hunger games. Within the next two years, the next two books of the trilogy were also released. Soon the hunger games was on The New York Time’s best seller list for more than 60 weeks in a row. Additionally because of the popularity of the hunger games books, Collins became Time's magazine's most influential people in 2010.
