                <h1>Suzanne Collions</h1>
                <p> The Hunger Games was written by American author and television writer Suzanne Collins. Born on August 10, 1962, Collins began her career in 1991 as a writer for children’s television shows. In September 2008, Scholastic Press, an American multinational publishing company, released The Hunger Games, the first book in her bestselling trilogy.              
                <br><br>
                Collins drew inspiration for the story from several sources, including the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, in which youths were sent into a deadly maze as a sacrifice. She was also influenced by her father’s career in the U.S. Air Force, which gave her a deep understanding of poverty, starvation, and the human cost of war.
                <br><br>
                The dystopian world of The Hunger Games was shaped by Collins’ reflections on the stark contrast between reality TV and war coverage in the media, imagining a society where violence is used as entertainment and a tool of control. This vision became the fictional nation of Panem, ruled by fear and the brutal Hunger Games.
                <br><br>
                Within two years, the next two books in the trilogy were released, and the series quickly became a global phenomenon. The Hunger Games stayed on The New York Times Best Seller list for more than 60 consecutive weeks. In 2010, Collins was named one of Time magazine’s Most Influential People because of the books’ worldwide impact.
