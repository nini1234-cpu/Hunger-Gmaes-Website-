                <h1>Plot Summary</h1>
                <p>Set in the dystopian nation of Panem, The Hunger Games follows sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in District 12, the poorest of the twelve districts controlled by the wealthy and oppressive Capitol. Every year, the Capitol holds a brutal televised event called The Hunger Games, in which one boy and one girl (called “tributes”) from each district are chosen by lottery to fight to the death in a controlled arena—until only one remains.
                When Katniss’s younger sister, Prim, is chosen as the female tribute, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She joins Peeta Mellark, the male tribute from District 12, who once saved her from starvation by giving her bread. They are taken to the Capitol, where they are trained, groomed, and paraded for entertainment. Their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, a past winner and now a drunk, struggles to prepare them but eventually helps them understand how to survive—and how to gain sponsors, who can send gifts during the Games.
                During the televised interviews, Peeta unexpectedly declares his love for Katniss, which creates a dramatic "star-crossed lovers" angle that the Capitol audiences love. Although Katniss is unsure if it’s genuine or a strategy, she plays along to increase their chances of survival.
                The Games begin in a deadly arena filled with traps and dangers. Katniss uses her hunting skills to stay alive, forming a temporary alliance with Rue, a 12-year-old girl from District 11 who reminds her of Prim. Rue is eventually killed by another tribute, Marvel, which devastates Katniss. She honors Rue by decorating her body with flowers, an act of rebellion that sparks resistance in the districts.
                When the Gamemakers change the rules mid-game to allow two victors from the same district, Katniss finds a badly injured Peeta and nurses him back to health. Their growing bond—real or performed—continues to gain sympathy from the public. Together, they survive several deadly encounters, including an attack by genetically altered wolf-like creatures made from the bodies of dead tributes.
