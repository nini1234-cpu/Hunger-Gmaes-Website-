                <h2>Power & Control</h2>
                <p>The Capitol uses fear and force to control the districts. The Hunger Games are a brutal reminder of their power—a punishment for a past rebellion and a warning not to rise up again. The Games are designed to entertain the Capitol while keeping the districts scared and divided. Surveillance, manipulation, and propaganda are key tools the Capitol uses to maintain its rule.</p>

                    “Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch—this is the Capitol’s way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy.” – Katniss Everdeen

                </div>
                <h2>Survival</h2>
                <p> Survival is the central theme of The Hunger Games. Katniss must rely on her instincts, hunting skills, and intelligence to stay alive in the arena. But survival is not only physical—it’s also emotional and psychological. From finding food to navigating alliances and avoiding traps, Katniss constantly faces life-or-death decisions. Outside the arena, survival means living in poverty, dealing with loss, and enduring the Capitol’s control.</p>
                <span class="quote">“The woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit farther into its arms.” – Katniss Everdeen</span>

                </div>
                <h2>Ineqauility & Class Division</h2>
                <p> Panem is sharply divided between the rich Capitol and the poor districts. While people in the Capitol live in luxury and treat the Games like entertainment, the districts suffer in poverty and are forced to sacrifice their children. The contrast between wealth and suffering is extreme, and the book critiques systems that allow such injustice to exist.</p>
                <span class="quote">“District 12: Where you can starve to death in safety.” – Katniss Everdeen</span>
            </div>

                <div class="icon">
                   <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor">

                   </svg>  
                </div>
                <h2>Rebellion & Resistance</h2>
                <p>Although Katniss doesn’t set out to be a rebel, her actions in the Games—like volunteering for Prim, honoring Rue, and threatening to eat the nightlock berries—challenge the Capitol’s authority. These small acts of defiance spark hope in the districts and hint at a larger rebellion beginning to build. The theme of resistance grows stronger as Katniss becomes a symbol of change.</p>
                <span class="quote">“I’m more than just a piece in their Games.” – Peeta Mellark</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="theme-card identity">
                <div class="icon">

                    </svg>
                </div>
                <h2>Identity & Performance</h2>
                <p> Katniss struggles with who she truly is versus the image she presents to survive. In the Games, she must perform for the audience—pretending to love Peeta, acting grateful, smiling for the cameras. The line between what’s real and what’s an act becomes blurred, especially in her relationship with Peeta. This theme explores how people change under pressure and how identity can be shaped by outside forces.</p>
                <span class="quote">“It’s all a big show. It’s all how you’re perceived.” – Haymitch Abernathy</span>
            </div>

            <div class="theme-card loyalty">

                    </svg>
                </div>
                <h2>Loyalty & Sacrifice</h2>
                <p>Katniss’s choices are often motivated by love and loyalty—especially to her sister, Prim. She volunteers to save her, protects Rue, and risks everything for Peeta. The story shows how far people will go to protect those they care about, and how loyalty can guide characters even in the most dangerous situations.</p>
                <span class="quote">“I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute!” – Katniss Everdeen</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="conclusion">These themes show that <em>The Hunger Games</em> is more than survival—it's a warning about identity, power, sacrifice, and the fight for justice.Through katniss's journey,we see how the human spirit can endure even in a world built on fear and control.</p>
